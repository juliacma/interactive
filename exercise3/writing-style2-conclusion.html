	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>As the Peabody explores new ideas during its renovation planning, we aim to provide a broad overview of techniques, technologies and tools that can assist visitors navigate around museum space and increase interactivity with exhibits. Our findings were split across four dimensions:</p>

	<p>First, we considered opportunities for transforming static displays into dynamic touchscreens. The key takeaways were that such screens must be carefully designed to accommodate multiple visitors simultaneously, be intuitive to use, and not detract from the physical exhibits. </p>
	
	<p>The second dimension investigated, VR and AR, gave similar lessons. While previously largely used as gimmicks, these technologies have tremendous potential to make museum spaces come alive, whether by animating skeletons, preserving heritage sites or giving visitors access to supplementary information and virtual avatars at kiosks throughout the museum. </p>

	<p>Third, we explored the applications of localization technologies to assist indoor navigation. The technologies spanned the spectrum from WiFi, to Bluetooth, to NFC, each posing unique financial and practical constraints. </p>

	<p>Finally, we acknowledged that any potential renovation and digital transformation should accommodate visitors with disabilities, whether in the construction and spatial design of the museum, in upgrading old maps and signage, or in deploying cutting-edge technologies that engage multiple senses. </p>

	<p>The intent was not necessarily to prescribe radical changes to the Peabody as it embarks on its renovation. Rather, it was to explore the realm of possibilities and take inspiration from museums, installations, companies, and creators that are working on memorable experiences with their use of modern technologies. Whichever of these many paths it decides to pursue, careful analysis is needed to ensure the proposed technologies are used in a manner consistent with the Peabodyâ€™s mission and values.</p>
